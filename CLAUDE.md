# llmdash — Conventions

## Stack
- Vanilla Node with **zero runtime dependencies**. Use Node builtins only
  (`node:http`, `node:sqlite`, `node:test`). No frameworks, no bundler, no build
  step. Requires Node 24+ (for `node:sqlite`).
- Frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS served as static files from `public/`.

## Patterns
- Configuration lives in `config.js`, overridable via `LLMDASH_*` env vars.
- Persist only what has no other history: limit **snapshots** go to SQLite
  (deduped). Activity/token stats are derived on demand from Claude Code logs —
  no extra storage.
- **Be honest in the UI.** When a number's source or scope differs from the
  headline data (e.g. account-wide limits vs local-log activity), say so.
- **Surface security-relevant defaults** (e.g. network binding) in the README and
  the startup log — never silently.
- HTTP responses carry baseline security headers (`nosniff`, CSP `default-src
  'self'`, `Referrer-Policy`) and reject non-GET/HEAD with 405.

## Multi-source
- The dashboard is **source-aware**: each tool is a `source` value in
  `usage_snapshots` and a tool block in the UI. Add a new tool as a new source
  flowing through the shared path — don't fork the store or the renderer.
- **Clamp externally-sourced percentages** (limit used %) to 0–100 before storing
  or deriving from them.
- When refactoring a single-source view to multi-source, **diff the rendered stat
  set** so nothing silently drops.
- Read live limits off the interval poller, never per HTTP request (Codex spawns a
  subprocess; keep that off the request path).

## Serving & UI
- Responses carry baseline security headers. The CSP allows `style-src
  'unsafe-inline'` (the UI sets dynamic widths/colors via inline styles) while
  `script-src` stays `'self'`. Keep style values to literals or coerced numbers —
  never interpolate untrusted input into a style or raw HTML (escape text).
- Static assets are served `cache-control: no-store` so code changes show on a
  plain refresh.
- Charts are plain SVG built into `innerHTML`. Verify the UI actually **renders**
  (not just that the page loads) — a blank-bar regression once passed a
  "page loads" check.

## Running & Testing
- `npm start` (or the `llmdash.service` systemd user service). Tests: `npm test`
  (node:test).
- Limit data requires Claude Code's statusline pointed at `scripts/statusline.js`.
